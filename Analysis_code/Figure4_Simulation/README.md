# Simulation Workflow

This folder contains the simulation workflow used to compare MiXcan, ctOWAS,
and PrediXcan.

The current workflow uses binary disease outcomes and the real haplotype pool
stored in Dropbox. Continuous-outcome simulation scripts and older sensitivity
scripts were moved to the archive because they are not part of the current
figure workflow.

## Input

The simulation uses this haplotype pool:

```text
/Users/zhusinan/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Paper_ctOWAS/Data/Simulation/X_pool_filtered.csv
```

By default, the scripts read this file through:

```r
PAPER_ctOWAS_DIR/Data/Simulation/X_pool_filtered.csv
```

You can override it with:

```bash
ctOWAS_SIM_X_POOL=/path/to/X_pool_filtered.csv
```

## Current Simulation Setting

The simulated model is:

```text
y1 = b0 + X b1 + e1
y2 =      X b2 + e2
y  = pi * y1 + (1 - pi) * y2
logit P(D = 1) = eta0 + eta1 * y1 + eta2 * y2
```

The cell-type proportion is generated as:

```text
pi ~ Beta(2, 3)
```

So `y1` is the minor cell type on average and `y2` is the major cell type on
average.

The current regularization setting is:

```text
fixed reg_scale = 0.05
```

For the all-panel simulation:

```text
Type I error scenario: 2000 replicates
Power scenarios:       200 replicates
```

## Scripts

### Step 0: Haplotype Sampling Helper

```text
0_hap_generation.R
```

Helper functions for sampling haplotypes and generating genotype matrices from
the real haplotype pool.

### Step 1: Binary Data Generation

```text
1_data_generation_binary.R
```

Generates simulated training and application data for binary disease outcomes.

### Step 2: Shared Simulation Runner

```text
2_run_sim.R
```

Trains prediction models and runs association testing for:

```text
MiXcan
ctOWAS
PrediXcan
```

### Step 3: Run All-Panel Simulation

```bash
Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/3_run_all_panel_simulation.R
```

Default output:

```text
Results/simulation/simulation_figure_with_predixcan_latest_reps/
```

Main outputs:

```text
condition_results/*.csv
simulation_full_results_with_predixcan.csv
simulation_summary_with_predixcan.csv
```

This step is expensive. The full all-panel simulation is approximately:

```text
6 panels * 5 x-values * (2000 + 4 * 200) = 84,000 replicate simulations
```

Expected runtime on the current machine is roughly several hours.

### Step 4: Plot All-Panel Figure

```bash
Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/4_plot_all_panel_simulation.R
```

Default input:

```text
Results/simulation/simulation_figure_with_predixcan_latest_reps/
```

Default output:

```text
simulation_figure_with_predixcan.pdf
simulation_figure_with_predixcan.png
```

To plot separate association p-values:

```bash
ctOWAS_SIM_PVALUE_MODE=sep Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/4_plot_all_panel_simulation.R
```

### Step 5: Run Type I Error for ABC Figures

```bash
Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/5_run_type1_error_2000rep.R
```

Default setting:

```text
b0 = 1
b1 = 0.5
b2 = 1
group = heter xy
replicates = 2000
```

This script is used when regenerating the Type I error component for the ABC
summary figures.

### Step 6: Run Power for ABC Figures

```bash
Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/6_run_power_eta4_200rep.R
```

Default setting:

```text
b0 = 1
b1 = 0.5
b2 = 1
group = heter xy
replicates = 200 per disease scenario
```

Power scenarios:

```text
eta1 = 0.2,  eta2 = 0.2
eta1 = 0.2,  eta2 = 0
eta1 = 0,    eta2 = 0.2
eta1 = -0.2, eta2 = 0.2
```

### Step 7: Plot ABC Summary Figures

Homogeneous SNP-Exp setting:

```bash
Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/7_plot_homogeneous_abc_summary.R
```

Output:

```text
Results/simulation/final_bar_summary_homogeneous/
```

Heterogeneous SNP-Exp setting:

```bash
Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/7_plot_heterogeneous_abc_summary.R
```

Output:

```text
Results/simulation/final_bar_summary_heterogeneous/
```

Each final folder contains:

```text
*.pdf
*.png
*_bar_summary_values.csv
replicate_results/
```

The `replicate_results/` folder stores the full replicate-level tables used to
produce the final ABC figures.

## Final Results Currently Kept

Only the latest homogeneous and heterogeneous ABC results are kept in the main
simulation results folder:

```text
Results/simulation/final_bar_summary_homogeneous/
Results/simulation/final_bar_summary_heterogeneous/
```

Older simulation outputs were moved to:

```text
Archive/Simulation_results_unused_20260720/
```

Older unused simulation scripts were moved to:

```text
Archive/Github/Simulation_unused_20260720/
```

## Useful Overrides

Run a smaller smoke test:

```bash
ctOWAS_SIM_PANELS=a \
ctOWAS_SIM_SCENARIOS=S1,S2 \
ctOWAS_SIM_BATCH_SIZE=10 \
ctOWAS_SIM_ITERATIONS=1 \
ctOWAS_SIM_TYPE1_ITERATIONS=1 \
Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/3_run_all_panel_simulation.R
```

Use LD from the application/test genotypes:

```bash
ctOWAS_SIM_LD_REFERENCE=test Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/3_run_all_panel_simulation.R
```

Use more workers:

```bash
ctOWAS_SIM_WORKERS=4 Rscript Analysis_code/Simulation/3_run_all_panel_simulation.R
```
